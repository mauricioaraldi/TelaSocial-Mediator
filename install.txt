Channels 

./channel is a directory for cached files based in system events. We maintain a few files in there ( relative to the config.json file events and also the data store ). 

Original Design 

Working Agents as Separated Process 

The idea is to use forever programatically to create connection with external sources. 
We do this via calling a separated nodeJs app, action agents in our architecture. So,
for example, the app that does the job of fetching remote RSS. 

This would return values in the disk = status — not yet implemented. So if there is a
failure, let's say dns fail ( = use case ), then an execution error code is kicked 
, the node app dies, and the main app is still fine. As we evolve things, we may want 
to keep log of these errors, so that is where Forever is good, we can track some of the 
execution status from our main app.

Influenced by this because we want to get rid of the repeated 'lame' polling.
