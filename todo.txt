Check the ./action/loadRSS.js design clearTimeouts 
Check the function handlers, in mediator, to comply with the new format, attempt spec in 
./scripts-cam.js ( an example ) which is sort of like RDF
Check timer ( static to 5 secs ) in ./action/loadRSS.js
[ ] Need to test the condition of timeout - network loading..

[x] Tested condition stderr for DNS invalid, for loadRSS. 

[x] Need to move the DNS use case to ./tests/ scripts. We need to be able to grab data from the tests and to measure
ehe pass no pass for everything. 

[x] Some of action scripts may generate an exception that has a lot of messages. As we wrap these 
    in the out.send ( and out.senderr ) we get now a propoerly formated json which is quite strange 
    example: 

    =={"result":"error","data":{"stack":"Error: ENOENT, No such file or directory 'channel/store/logo/image-2012-01-18T21:13:29.804Z.jpg'","message":"ENOENT, No such file or directory 'channel/store/logo/image-2012-01-18T21:13:29.804Z.jpg'","errno":2,"code":"ENOENT","path":"channel/store/logo/image-2012-01-18T21:13:29.804Z.jpg"}}==
